More Dallas ASE Information,"The start time for Tuesday morning has been changed from 9am to 8am.  
Breakfast will be served at 7:30.  Therefore, shuttle pick up times at the 
hotel for Tuesday morning have been changed to 7:10, 7:25, and 7:40 am.  
Again, the last shuttle is not recommended if you intend to have breakfast at 
the ASE.

Some of you had asked about a coordinated dinner for Sunday night.  Since 
arrival times into Dallas vary greatly, we are leaving you to your own 
devices for Sunday night.  We are however, planning a group dinner for Monday 
night after we wrap up for the day.  We will arrange transportation from the 
ASE to the restaurant and from the restaurant back to the hotel.  Currently, 
Monday's agenda shows a completion time of 6:30pm.  Therefore, we are 
planning to head to dinner directly from the ASE without a break or trip back 
to the hotel.

RAC risk reporting,"Currently, members of Ted Murphy's group have been preparing certain

Book reconciliation - as needed
Stress testing - as needed
Back testing - weekly
Correlation Matrix - bi-weekly


I have obtained a copy of all reports currently being prepared.  In the

to Risk Operations.  In order to do that, on a report by report basis, we 
need to determine what group within Risk Operations should prepare these 
reports (Risk Management and Controls or the individual commodity risk 
management groups).

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.

OU Salaries,"Sally,

Just something from a recruiting prospective for us to think about, 
remembering the situation from last fall of George making the mistake of 
extending verbal offers, quoting incorrect salaries, and the difference being 
recovered by your RC, I wanted to bring the potential of a residual OU salary 
issue to your attention.  

The salary being offered for another internship or full-time position, which 
ever applies, may appear (to the OU candidates) to be wrong.  Interns will 
enter the program at the same pay rate, $3,000 monthly and the full-time 
analysts at 40k.  As you know, both salaries are non-negotiable for 
consistency amongst the program participants.  

I'm sure questions will come up regarding compensation and thought we could 
discuss the inevitable.  I would really like your input on how to ""soften the 
blow"".

I look forward to your response.

prudency policy in line with that of North America.  In response to these

have determined that all discretionary prudency and general reserves 
(including VAR based prudency) should be eliminated. Deal specific prudency 
will, however, remain. In order to avoid any arguments with AA near the 
quarter end the release to the London summary DPR should happen today for the 
August month end.

As I alluded to in my note yesterday, Enron has received a commitment for $1 billion in additional credit from our agent banks. This is great news, more from a market perception standpoint than an actual cash need. You can be assured that senior management is totally focused on the need to shore up the balance sheet with additional equity, now that we have the debt in place, but the equity we be a longer process.

Attached is an updated sheet regarding what needs to be done at night regarding MDEA and our old nightly duties. 

Also there is now a folder near the MAPP printer (between Dean and Don) that will include all the nightly faxes and load sheets.  The folder will help us keep track of what has been faxed in case EES trans calls complaining.  The load sheets are needed for the daily forecasting expained in the SOP 13 Dean sent out last week. In the folder there are extra copies of the SOP 13 in case you want it as well as GENCO phone numbers in case Allegheny calls. 

Hopefully this will help create some consistency on nights and provide the day people access to the MDEA load sheets.  If you have any questions please give me a ring.

(No Subject),"Jacques,

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

Re:,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  
Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding 
the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business 
meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is 
even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try 
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working 
and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet 
just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a 
round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and 
jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

(No Subject),"To whom it may concern:

In previous years Enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's 
employees.  I have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag 
football.  In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable 
organizations in the community.  With these two things in mind, I wanted to 
propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I 
know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including 
flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee 
interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community.

My questions are : Is this idea plausible?  If so, who should I contact with 
regards to setting up the tournament?

anaylsis, confirmations, physical product scheduling and cash management 
reaffirmed their roles in effectively accessing, managing and mitigating 
operational risk.  This focus on operational risk management  will ensure the

Thanks for running the league.  It was fun.  And
thanks for selecting Boumann as your QB in the first
round of the playoffs.  And tell P-Love that I
appreciated him leaving Warner for me at the 7th pick
in the draft.

Anyway, since I no longer work in the Enron building,
it would probably be easiest to drop a check in the
mail:

Reagan Mathews
17210 Canyon Stream Ct.
Houston, TX  77095

By my calculation the amount should be:
$608.5

(1614-840) x 75% = 580.5 + $28 = $608.5.

$28 comes from...my total costs of -132, plus my paid
amount of 120, plus my winnings of 40. 

The reason I bring this up is that it looks like the
""Finances"" page of the website is double counting the
$50 entry fee.  Anyway, let me know if you have a
different number for the distributions.

Christine Walton Resume,"Hi Don,

How are you?  Mark told me that you had mentioned to him that I could send
my resume to you again regarding the analyst position.  Thank you very much
for offering to help again, I really appreciate it! I think the position
sounds very interesting and I would love to have the opportunity to speak
with someone about it.

I have attached my resume in Word 2000. Please feel free to contact me if
you have any questions.

Have a great weekend!

Thanks again.

clarifications/revisions. The ISO invites entities interested in discussing
these ideas and other ideas related to distributed generation to attend.  It

Just wanted to get this out to you in the hope that you havent worked on January's and this month's schedule. I had already planned to be in Denver to ski (know any good resorts?) and then spend the new year with my family..earlier the plan was to do this from the26th onwards..as scheduled, but since we might not get our vacation from Enron at all.. I was wondering if everything being exegient, I could take off a little early and arrive into say the 4th or so of Jan?

This of course being that I dont upset too many other schedules and no news occurs upon us which would preclude this.

Also on an unrelated note..the people from Trader News called and wanted prices,...but I have not sent them anything not knowing our legal position on the same.


See you in a bit.

  I was just following up to my last email regarding the status of job opportunities in your group.  I had a death in the family and was out last week.  I know you guys are probably coming up on bidweek now and have very little time to interview.  I would really like a one on one with you to discuss opportunities as soon as you can  make some time available.  As I mentioned before, having had the opportunity to go up and observe the guys helped tremendously.  Thank you again for that.  This is exactly  what I want to do.  I hate to come out sounding like a pest, but, I am eager to start.   I want to work the night shift and get back into the fasted paced environment.  Thank you for your time, Don, hoping to hear from you soon.

Energy Operations has experienced a 140% increase in transaction growth as a

business.  However, resources have only increased at a rate of 11% due to the 
efficient use of existing resources.  As a result the per unit cost of

OU Salaries,"Sally,

Just something from a recruiting prospective for us to think about, 
remembering the situation from last fall of George making the mistake of 
extending verbal offers, quoting incorrect salaries, and the difference being 
recovered by your RC, I wanted to bring the potential of a residual OU salary 
issue to your attention.  

The salary being offered for another internship or full-time position, which 
ever applies, may appear (to the OU candidates) to be wrong.  Interns will 
enter the program at the same pay rate, $3,000 monthly and the full-time 
analysts at 40k.  As you know, both salaries are non-negotiable for 
consistency amongst the program participants.  

I'm sure questions will come up regarding compensation and thought we could 
discuss the inevitable.  I would really like your input on how to ""soften the 
blow"".

I look forward to your response.

Internet E-mail,"
In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.",4/12/2011,patti.thompson@enron.com

CG&E Agreements,"JD,

To follow up on our earlier meeting, attached are the following documents for CG&E:

	- TSA network handbook which summarizes all requirements
	- Request for Network Transmission Service (Network Application)
	- Request to designate a New Network Resource (only required when we are ready to designate a resource)
	- OATT Tariff Attachments that includes Attachment F, Network Service Agreement and Attachment G, Network Operating Agreement
	- CG&E TSA, Transmission Scheduling Agent Agreement

If EPMI does not already have the Network Transmission Agreements in place, then CG&E indicated that the process was to first fill out the Network Application and then they will send the Network Service Agreement and the Network Operating Agreement.  

My contacts at CG&E have been Paul Jett  (513) 287-1770 and Steve Averbeck (513) 287-2876.  The government affairs contact is Gloria Ogenyi x 58202.

(No Subject),"To whom it may concern:

In previous years Enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's 
employees.  I have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag 
football.  In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable 
organizations in the community.  With these two things in mind, I wanted to 
propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I 
know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including 
flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee 
interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community.

My questions are : Is this idea plausible?  If so, who should I contact with 
regards to setting up the tournament?

Kirit Purbhoo Resume,"Hi Don,

Attached please find my resume for your review.  I liked to thank you for allowing me to sit with the shift guys for the past few nights.  The exposure has been invaluable.  I worked closely with Joe Errigo, who has been extremely helpful in showing me the routine of the job.  I received some hands on training with some of the work that is expected from the shift crew.  In particular, checkouts, price discovery, identifying constraint paths, input deals into the P&L  and Enpower.  

The demanding and fast paced nature of this position is exactly what appeals to me.  My past experience with trading and scheduling should provide a good base.  I would like to sit down with you and discuss opportunities within your group.  Again, thank you for the opportunity, hope to hear from you soon.

I am currently in the middle of selecting our Japan Banking Relationship and 
several questions have come up.

It is important that I understand how your trading settlements will work.

I have spoken to Louise Kitchen about Enron Online and where it fits in with 
our banking.  Enron Online does not interface with the banking.  It 
interfaces with a trading system/accounting system?  What I need to know is 
what system is planned for Enron Japan's accounting for the trading.  The 
accounting system you use will interface with our Treasury system.

What it boils down to, is the payment format that we will use to make local 
Japanese payments may need special programming to meet the needs of the 
Japanese  - English translation. The accounting system used will need to 
interface with our Treasury software to process the settlements, we will need 
to interface with the bank.

mdea imbalance,"I was looking at the imbalance on November 1 and it shows that we are long as many as 8 mgw's.  I know how it is and do not want to armchair quarterback but we need explanations of why this happens and I don't see any in the services comment section.  It is imperative that we keep notes and try our best not to be more than 2 mgw's off either way.  that is 2 minus the bandwith allotment.

I know you guys are probably coming up on bidweek now and have very little time to interview.  I would really like a one on one with you to discuss opportunities as soon as you can  make some time available.

Thank you for your time, Don, hoping to hear from you soon.

Fundamental Operating Standards,"Attached for your review are the fundamental operating standards and controls 
that have been developed by the Wholesale Services group.  These standards 
are to be met by all Enron offices and by each functional group within the 
operations process.  Qualitative standards should be viewed as the basic 
measures to be taken when opening a new office or trading a new commodity.  
Statistics measuring compliance with quantitative standards will be monitored 
on a daily basis and any issues that arise will be addressed immediately.

As business unit heads, you play a critical role in working with Operations 
to ensure that proper controls are in place and working effectively.  Please 
review this document and let me know if you have any questions or wish to 
discuss further.

I have been with Enron for about a year doing power origination and trading in Latin America. I recently moved back to the US and have been working with EES for a couple of months. Before Enron I worked a few years in PSEG trading and Constellation Power Source, but not as a trader. I know the northeast (PJM mainly) power markets (24 hour) fairly well. I have always been interested in getting into the trading business and that's why this position caught my attention.

I hope you feel there may be a potential match here. If you think so, please let me know and I can forward you my resume.

Disbanding of Joel Henenberg's Team,"I have a stretch goal for the operations budget under Enron Americas to 
reduce costs by the end of the year.  To this end, I have recently studied 
possible options for reaching the targeted savings.  To make the best 
decision on this, I have reviewed functions within my team on the basis of 
core versus non-core functions, and the inherent cost versus value 
proposition.

As a result, I made the decision last week to disband Joel Henenberg's team.  
To fulfill the role of Joel and his team in leading IT initiatives, we will 
lean on the appropriate IT project managers and the business sponsors/end 
users.   

Joel and his team were told of this decision on Friday afternoon last week.  
Our HR rep spent some time with the team explaining the corporate 
re-deployment service that they all will be working through over the next few 
weeks.  
Let me know if you have any questions regarding this.  While it was a tough 
decision, I feel comfortable having made it.    ",6/16/2010,johnny.palmer@enron.com

Update to Bus Pass Information,"
Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Re:,"We've started breaking out separate P&L's.  It's been a very difficult 
process so far for a number of reasons.  The last processes will be 
separating out the P&L on the executive reports and on VAR. That will happen 
this week.  Meanwhile, the P&L will be retroactive to the start of the year 
and we are going through all the positions such that the total skew is zero 
or an adjustment will be made to get it there.   At the end of the year there 
will be a number next to Maggi's name that he will not dispute.  His

Re: FW: LNG Weekly Update,"Looks good.  certainly an area we need more focus on.  Obviously the most 
important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative 
to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term.  
As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year 
and five year averages.  It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis 
were geared the same way.  The fact that lng shipments are x this week is 
meaningless.  the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely 
useful.  if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move 
discussion that way.  what's switching vis a vis last year.   whats 
production relative to last year.  it simplifies the fundamental analysis.

FINAL DECISION ON ACCRUAL VALUE,"Tom has come to a decision on what to do with the ubiquitous accrual value.  
60% of this value should be credited to Greg's Transport expense on a monthly 
basis.  Tom, in turn, will cover Ed on this portion of the expense.

For example:

Accrual Value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of April.

This means that:

Greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 = $180,000
Tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 = $120,000

Greg's Transport Expense is ($700,000)
So, Tom will cover                      $180,000 of this expense
Greg's adjusted Expense is   ($520,000)

Greg's P&L is net better off by the $180,000 of accrual value
Tom's P&L is net better off by $120,000  of accrual value which had not been 
previously recognized.
Ed's P&L is net unchanged from all of the above.

MISO Approved for Start Up of Transmission Functions,"Yesterday, FERC gave approval for MISO to begin regional transmission operations on December 15, 2001.  This will include administration of their regional transmission tariff, security coordination, and ""other regional transmission organization functions.""  I expect they are going to function very similarly to the manner in which SPP and MAPP currently operate.  I verified this with Roger Harzy at the MISO, and he confirmed they plan to be operational on Dec. 15th.

I will be at MISO next week Tuesday and Wednesday, and will be working to make sure we are set up to take service under their tariff and fully understand their operations. If you have any specific questions, please send me mail, and I will work to address them while I am visiting.

Attached is an updated sheet regarding what needs to be done at night regarding MDEA and our old nightly duties. 

Also there is now a folder near the MAPP printer (between Dean and Don) that will include all the nightly faxes and load sheets.  The folder will help us keep track of what has been faxed in case EES trans calls complaining.  The load sheets are needed for the daily forecasting expained in the SOP 13 Dean sent out last week. In the folder there are extra copies of the SOP 13 in case you want it as well as GENCO phone numbers in case Allegheny calls. 

Hopefully this will help create some consistency on nights and provide the day people access to the MDEA load sheets.  If you have any questions please give me a ring.

Happy Holidays,

Staff Meetings,"Same time, same place -- just not as often!

I would like to maintain management team meetings on Monday afternoons from 
2:30 to 3:30 in EB3014.  My plan is to alternate weeks for ENA and EGM 
meetings.  There are a few direct reports, whose work extends across ENA and 
EGM, who will attend both meetings.  Today was the ENA Management Team 
meeting.  Next Monday, August 28 will be the first meeting with the EGM 
management team.  I will look forward to staying current with each one of you 
and Brent on the growth and challenges of the businesses within Enron Global 
Markets.  

I have asked Patti to cancel one-on-one meetings that we had scheduled on the 
calendar going forward.  Although this new structure changes the direct line

professional development of each of you.  I hope that we can schedule time

Below is our high level explanation of the Energy Operations (including EOL) 
increase in 2001 plan over 2000 forecast of $5.1 million.  If you have any 
questions, please let me know.


Energy Operations has experienced a 140% increase in transaction growth as a 
result of EOL activity, requiring additional resources to support this new 
business.  However, resources have only increased at a rate of 11% due to the 
efficient use of existing resources.  As a result the per unit cost of 
supporting individual transactions has decreased significantly in the 100% to 
400%+ range.

Order re. transfer of operational control to MISO,"On July 27, 2001, the Commission approved the application of Minnesota Power and Superior Water, Light and Power Company to transfer operational control of certain jurisdictional transmission facilities to the Midwest ISO when it becomes operational.  The approval was conditioned on Great River (MP's only network transmission customer) reaching agreement MP on how Great River's facilities will be operated by the ISO.  

With regard to the Midwest RTO, the Commission stated its approval of the transfer of operational control does not constitute a finding regarding the scope of an RTO for the Midwest.

the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron

I may have already sent this to you.  It is a process flow for how we should 
structure, execute, and follow up findings.  Let me know if you have any 
changes.  I've already given it to Donna, Cassandra, and Lynn Bellinghausen 
as a draft.

Also, just to let you know, the schedule is still being revised.  The latest 
version is with Cassandra.  I'll send you a new copy once they've revised 
it.  It will then goto Lynn's group.

A note on PMA's,"You may notice that 9911 PMA's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final 
P&L.  You will also notice that the detail following the majority of the 
adjustments is Unaccounted For Gas.  At the close of business for the 991 
P&L, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.  We 
thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to 
offset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.  Therefore, 
the net impact of 9911 PMA's is $41,119 or 2% of last day P&L.

I just wanted to congratulate the team on a great P&L for the month of 
November.

Happy New Year - No Y2K Fear!,"We are wrapping up several hours in the office and have tested all 
commodities front to back.  We found a few minor issues, primarily reports 
with report dates that were incorrect.  The content and underlying 
calculations in the reports were correct.  These were really just query and 
formatting issues.  All were quick fixes of five minutes or less.  So at this 
point we feel confident about our system situation.  More will unfold with 
counterparties next week, but hopefully all found this as uneventful as have 
we.  

Hope your new year's celebration was fun.  We saw pictures of the London 
festivies on TV as we were cooking our New Year's eve dinner last night at

Doorstep RAC Direction,"Met today w/ Causey and Sally to discuss Doorstep going forward. Following is 
my goal with this process.  Rick Carson will co-ordinate RAC's efforts in 
this area pulling in other RAC people as required.


- RAC will participate in review to determine which offices will be inspected 
and on what frequency
- RAC will help design and participate as required in inspections
- I will be able to see, through the RAC website, a list of all offices, a 
list of all offices requiring inspection, when an office was inspected, 
findings from that inspection and the follow-up from the findings.
- If follow up is not happening, a ""red flagged"" reminder notice should be 
issued via email. 

This has been a huge effort and we have to have this going forward. This is 
one ball that can not be dropped.

SEPA and schedules,"Hey guys,

I talked to Kayne on Monday about the various contracts we have with MDEA to ensure they continued for 2002.  KOCH, NRG, and SEPA all carry over. However, as Mike confirmed in checkouts, SEPA does NOT flow on weekends or holidays and SEPA puts out the tag without consulting us even though the schedule changes regularly.   Currently there is no SEPA schedule in OATI or the services contract book starting 01/07/2002.   Make sure when we do the next day schedules the SEPA contract matches OATI once SEPA puts out the new tags.

Last month we didn't have to place as close attention when scheduling because SEPA put out a tag for the entire month and Laura matched it in the services book for us. 

And for your reference, the January Entergy OASIS #  for WR to MDEA (30MW all day) is: 1025604 (Daily NN-6).  

Happy New Year!

Carrie

Panama City Doorstep,"Dear Lynn,

As it turns out, there is no deal documentation for the Panama City deals in 
Panama (everything is in Houston).  Therefore, the deal test will need to be 
done from Houston and we won't need anyone from your group to attend the 
upcoming doorstep.  Scott and Michelle Bruce will obtain the population when 
then are in Panama and also write the report.

Best regards

Power Trader Position,"I saw a job posting for a Power Trader (24-Hr real time) in the Enron intranet and I was wandering if we could meet to discuss further. 

I have been with Enron for about a year doing power origination and trading in Latin America. I recently moved back to the US and have been working with EES for a couple of months. Before Enron I worked a few years in PSEG trading and Constellation Power Source, but not as a trader. I know the northeast (PJM mainly) power markets (24 hour) fairly well. I have always been interested in getting into the trading business and that's why this position caught my attention.

I hope you feel there may be a potential match here. If you think so, please let me know and I can forward you my resume.

Thank you

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34

I have been with Enron for about a year doing power origination and trading

EES for a couple of months. Before Enron I worked a few years in PSEG trading 
and Constellation Power Source, but not as a trader. I know the northeast

interested in getting into the trading business and that's why this position

However I need a rough estimate of who was in over the week end and the extra hours they put in ect. If you could give me a rough estimate of business that was done during the week end will also help our story.

I will get the forms from Kim and have her review as she is on the committee that review these personnel best requests, so she no's what to put in that will really work.

Re:,"Frank,

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.
